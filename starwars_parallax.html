        <h2>Star Wars</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Star Wars saga</b>, also referred to as the <b>Skywalker saga</b>, is the main line of Star Wars
            films
            that began in 1977 by
            George Lucas, with Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope being the first film. While a larger universe of stories
            and
            characters has evolved around it, the saga films tell the story of the Skywalker family through a set of
            three
            trilogies. The original trilogy ran from 1977 to 1983, which was followed by the prequel trilogy from 1999
            to
            2005, and
            the sequel trilogy from 2015 to 2019.

        <h2>Darth Vader</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Anakin Skywalker</b> was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic
            Republic and the
            prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the Force. Also known as "<b>Ani</b>"
            during his
            childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear" from his accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His
            alter ego,
            <b>Darth Vader</b>, the Dark Lord of the Sith, was created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of the
            Force,
            pledging his
            allegiance to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious at the end of the Republic Era.
