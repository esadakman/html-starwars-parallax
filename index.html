        <h2>Star Wars</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>Star Wars saga</b>, also referred to as the <b>Skywalker saga</b>, is the main line of Star Wars
            films
            that began in 1977 by
            George Lucas, with Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope being the first film. While a larger universe of stories
            and
            characters has evolved around it, the saga films tell the story of the Skywalker family through a set of
            three
            trilogies. The original trilogy ran from 1977 to 1983, which was followed by the prequel trilogy from 1999
            to
            2005, and
            the sequel trilogy from 2015 to 2019.

        <h2>Luke Skywalker</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Luke Skywalker </b> was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the <b>greatest Jedi </b> the galaxy has ever known. 
            Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. 
            A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries. 
            Haunted by Ben Solo’s fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a distant world, ignoring the galaxy’s pleas for help. 
            But his solitude would be interrupted – and Luke Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the struggle between good and evil.

        <h2>Darth Vader</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Anakin Skywalker</b> was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic
            Republic and the
            prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the Force. Also known as "<b>Ani</b>"
            during his
            childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear" from his accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His
            alter ego,
            <b>Darth Vader</b>, the Dark Lord of the Sith, was created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of the
            Force,
            pledging his
            allegiance to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious at the end of the Republic Era.

            and a legendary Jedi Master
            who played a significant role in the fate of the galaxy during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He
            was the
            mentor of both Anakin and Luke Skywalker, training both in the ways of the Force. He had a long and
            tumultuous career
